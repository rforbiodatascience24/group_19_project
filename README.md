Group 19 R for Bio Data project.

The data is retrieved from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/383/cervical+cancer+risk+factors.zip){.uri}. The dataset focuses on the prediction of indicators of cervical cancer and was collected in Caracas, Venezuela. It contains information and medical history of 858 patients. Several patients did not answer some of the questions, giving rise to missing values.

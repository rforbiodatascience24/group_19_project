### Introduction

-   Cervical cancer is a significant cause of mortality in low-income countries.

-   The dataset:

    -   Medical records from 858 female patients.
    -   Random sampling of patients between the years 2012 and 2013.
    -   Gynecology service at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela.

### Aim

-   Find correlation between variables and cancer diagnosis

-   Chi-squared test:

    -   To evaluate whether there is a significant association between two variables.

-   PCA:

    -   To identify patterns and relationships in data.

-   Visualization:

    -   To present the data using various plots.

## Methods: Data cleaning {background-color="brown"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Cleaning NAs

-   Change values 1.0 and 0.0 to yes and no

-   Changing columns to numeric

-   Renaming columns for consistency

## Results: PCA {background-color="brown"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 16px;"}
-   Extract the rotation matrix

    -   The rotation matrix in PCA shows how the original variables contribute to each principal component (PC)

-   Arrows in similar directions = positive correlation

-   Arrows in opposite directions = negative correlation

-   Arrows near the origin = minimal contribution to the components

-   The length of an arrow indicates how strongly that variable contributes to the principal components

-   Extract Eigenvalues of the PCA\

-   Represents the amount of variance explained by each principal component

-   PC4 and PC5 explains 50-60% of the variance

## Conclusions {background-color="brown"}

-   No strong correlations between the variables.
-   Further research needed.

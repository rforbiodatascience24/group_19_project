## Introduction to Data and Aim {background-color="brown"}

Dataset: Information including medical records of 858 female patients. Covers a random sampling of patients between 2012 and 2013 who attended the gynecology service at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela.

Columns (variables): Different informative variables including medical records\
Rows (observations): Patient IDs.\
Data format: Wide format

**AIM:** We aim to find connections and correlations between the various variables and whether the patients are diagnosed with cervical cancer.

## Methods: Data cleaning {background-color="brown"}

1.  Changed ? to NA:
    -   Consistency in missing data.

    -   Better compatibility with libraries.

    -   Avoiding misinterpretation.
2.  Change values 1.0 and 0.0 to yes and no:
    -   Avoid misinterpretation

    -   Improve readability

    -   Avoid ambiguity

    -   Make it better suited for data visualization.

3.  Renaming columns (example: Smoked..years. to Smokes.packs.years):
    -   The previous names are harder to read and use in the code.

    -   Aligns them with standard convention (no special characters) which makes their meaning more intuitive.
4.  Change columns that included numerics from character columns to numeric columns:
    -   Consistency in the data.

    -   Avoid errors when plotting.

    -   Converting them to numeric ensures they can be analyzed mathematically.
5.  Change columns to integers:
    -   Reflect the data’s nature as count data (a person can’t have 2.5 pregnancies)

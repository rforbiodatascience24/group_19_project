#### Introduction
-   Cervical cancer is a significant cause of mortality in low-income              countries.
-   The dataset:
    -   Medical records from 858 female patients
    -   Random sampling of patients between the years 2012 and 2013
    -   Gynecology service at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas,            Venezuela

#### Aim of the Project
-   Find correlation between variables and cancer diagnosis
-   Chi-squared test:
    -   To evaluate whether there is a significant association between two             variables.
-   PCA:
    -   To identify patterns and relationships in data.
-   Visualization:
    -   To present the data using various plots.

## Methods: Data cleaning {background-color="brown"}

1.  Changed ? to NA:
    -   Consistency in missing data.

    -   Better compatibility with libraries.

    -   Avoiding misinterpretation.
2.  Change values 1.0 and 0.0 to yes and no:
    -   Avoid misinterpretation

    -   Improve readability

    -   Avoid ambiguity

    -   Make it better suited for data visualization.

## Methods: Data cleaning {background-color="brown"}

3.  Renaming columns (example: Smoked..years. to Smokes.packs.years):
    -   The previous names are harder to read and use in the code.

    -   Aligns them with standard convention (no special characters) which makes their meaning more intuitive.
4.  Change columns that included numerics from character columns to numeric columns:
    -   Consistency in the data.

    -   Avoid errors when plotting.

    -   Converting them to numeric ensures they can be analyzed mathematically.
5.  Change columns to integers:
    -   Reflect the data’s nature as count data (a person can’t have 2.5 pregnancies)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Assumes that all variables are equally important
-   Handling numeric values
-   Scaling the data
-   Two distinct clusters
-   Few outliers

## Results: PCA {background-color="brown"}

-   The data in the PCA coordinates

-   Longer arrows explains more of the variance
